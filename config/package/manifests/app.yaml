# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
 `provider-gcp` is a Crossplane infrastructure provider for the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).
 The provider that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model GCP infrastructure and services (e.g. [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/), [GKE clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in GCP based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's portable resource abstractions, enabling GCP resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
